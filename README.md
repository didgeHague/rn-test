## Risk Narrative Tech Test

Implementation of the Risk Narrative tech test. 
Due to time constraints there are some limitations in the implementation and testing.

Ideally, would have added tests for the services using Mockito. Would have added unhappy path tests as well. 
Error handling isn't the best as there are scenarios where the API returns 500 errors.



### Build and Run Tests
`mvn clean install`

### Run Application
`mvn spring-boot:run `
